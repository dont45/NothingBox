# NothingBox
A corona-19 Do Nothing Switch Box that shuts itself off.

I have seen this box on YouTube and have wanted to build one.  Now that I'm 
stuck at home by myself I decided to build one using an old processor I have
and to program it in assembler.  After studying verious options I decided to
use an Atmel Mega16.

MY build will include eight toggle switches which the 'user' can toggle on, 
along with a robotic finger which will turn them off in the exact order in
which they were turned on.

Example of someone else's box can be seen in action here:

My only plagerism is watching this video.  
The design and firmware are all of my own creation.
